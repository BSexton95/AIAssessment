## How to play
The goal of this game is to demonstrate AI steering behaviors and path finding. There are three enemy ships in the game to demonstrate AI.
The enemy ship on the left side demonstrates both wandering behaviour and fleeing behaviour. When the player ship collides with this ship the game
will close indicating you have won the game. The enemy ship on the right demonstrates both wandering and seeking behaviour. When the player ship 
collides with this ship the player ship will respawn at the bottom of the map. The enemy ship in the top middle of the map demonstrates AI path
finding. The player ship will respawn at the bottom of the map when colliding with this ship as well.
